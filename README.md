# Rendimiento de Python Vs Cython

Cython is a library that helps us translate python code to C to reduce the time it takes to execute.

In the performance tests, the implementation of a logistic regression algorithm and a solution of the knapsack problem using a genetic algorithm were used.

1. In the [src/algorithms_python](https://github.com/jonattan-infante/Cython_vs_Python/tree/main/src/algorithms_python) directory you can see the implementation of both.
2. In the [src/algorithms_cython](https://github.com/jonattan-infante/Cython_vs_Python/tree/main/src/algorithms_cython) directory you can see the implementation of both in Cython.
3. In the [annotations](https://github.com/jonattan-infante/Cython_vs_Python/tree/main/annotations) directory you can see the annotation generated by Cython.
4. In the [results](https://github.com/jonattan-infante/Cython_vs_Python/tree/main/results) directory you can see the csv generated by test.
5. In [notebook,](https://github.com/jonattan-infante/Cython_vs_Python/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) you can consult the complete analysis.
